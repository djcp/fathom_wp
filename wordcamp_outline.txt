* Intro
** Me - Run blogs.law, 954 blogs and a bunch more in a few different places.
** How I came to BDD

* Intro to BDD
** Logical successor to test driven development, focusing on higher level application behavior.
** Outside in - meaning you focus on the parts users interact with first - and the implementation flows from that.
** Theoretically delivers more value to the client quicker because you focus on fulfilling the stuff that matters to the client - the external interface - first. Too simplistic, but makes some sense.
** Uses "stories" to describe what a user does with an application. These stories are (mostly) human readable and - in the case of Gherkin - an interpreted DSL.
** Show sample story
** PHP alternatives to ruby's cucumber / capybara: behat, cuke4php

* Intro to cucumber, capybara, and selenium
** Gherkin is the DSL for web testing
** sample feature - Scenario, givens, whens, thens. 
** install guide slide
** run a feature

* BDD workflow
** Add a new feature - default font size.
** Move on to another feature - 

* Misc
** cucumber allows for very flexible and expressive browser automation.
** can be pointed at *any* domain, so can be used to test live or staging sites.
** the future - turn this into a generic testing framework.
** challenges - HTML in wordpress is sub-optimal for selenium testing, but I have yet to find something I couldn't interact with.
